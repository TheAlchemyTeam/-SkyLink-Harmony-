### A lovely project that can provide the informations of China region's weather
***
本项目旨在开发一个“智能气象社交平台”，名为“天翼互联”，结合“天翼”和“互联”的概念，致力于为用户提供实时天气信息、气候变化监测和社区互动服务。随着全球气候变化问题的日益严峻，公众对天气信息的需求也愈发迫切。现有的天气应用虽然能提供基本的天气预报，但在用户互动、社区支持和气候教育方面仍有很大提升空间。因此，本项目将通过整合气象数据与社交功能，搭建一个既能满足用户日常需求又能提升环保意识的平台。
<br>This project aims to develop an "Intelligent Meteorological Social Platform" named "Sky Wing Interconnect," combining the concepts of "Sky Wing" and "Interconnect," dedicated to providing users with real-time weather information, climate change monitoring, and community interaction services. As the issue of global climate change becomes increasingly severe, the public's demand for weather information is also becoming more urgent. Although existing weather applications can provide basic weather forecasts, there is still much room for improvement in user interaction, community support, and climate education. Therefore, this project will integrate meteorological data with social functions to build a platform that can meet users' daily needs while also enhancing environmental awareness.
<br>我们的愿景是成为国内领先的气象社交平台，通过数据驱动的决策和用户参与，推动社会对气候变化的关注与应对能力。该平台不仅为用户提供准确的天气预报，还将通过社区分享和教育模块，增强用户的环保意识，形成一个以气候变化为中心的社会互动平台。
<br>Our vision is to become a leading meteorological social platform in the country, driving societal attention to climate change and enhancing the ability to respond through data-driven decision-making and user participation. The platform will not only provide users with accurate weather forecasts but also enhance environmental awareness through community sharing and educational modules, forming a social interaction platform centered around climate change.
